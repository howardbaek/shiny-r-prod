The project for this exercise is called **Performance Exercise 1**.\n\n## Setup\n\nUsing what you just learned about the [`{profvis}`](http://rstudio.github.io/profvis/examples.html#example-3---profiling-a-shiny-application), your task is to run the profiler for the LEGO Bricks application contained in this project. Recall that to run the profiler in a Shiny app created with `{golem}`, change the `run_app()` call at the end of the `dev/run_dev.R` script to the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprofvis::profvis({\n  print(run_app())\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce the application is open, try changing a couple of the inputs contained in the sidebar. Once the outputs in the app refresh, close the profiler by stopping the R process in the R console. You should now see the `{profvis}` report appear as a new tab in your web browser.\n\n## Questions\n\n* Are you able to identify any performance bottlenecks in the application?\n* If so, can you think of ways to fix the issues?",
