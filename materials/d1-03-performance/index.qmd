## Performance Agenda

* Profiling your Shiny app with {profvis}
* Lightning-quick data loading/querying with {arrow} & *.parquet* files
* Asynchronous processes with {crew}

# {profvis}: an R package for profiling R code <br>(including Shiny apps)

## What is {profvis}?

R package for visualizing how (and how fast/slow) your R code runs

[{profvis} website](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/index.html)

![](assets/img/example_profvis_report.png)

::: {.notes}
* The package is from Posit
* Help you understand the bottlenecks in your R code
* and, you guessed it, it works with Shiny too
:::

## Working with {profvis} & {golem} {auto-animate=true}

Our `dev/run_dev.R` script is where we can profile our app interactively.

```{.r}
options(golem.app.prod = FALSE)

golem::detach_all_attached()

golem::document_and_reload()

run_app()
```

```{.r}
options(golem.app.prod = FALSE)

golem::detach_all_attached()

golem::document_and_reload()

profvis::profvis({
  print(run_app())
})
```

::: {.notes}
You need to wrap the `run_app()` function in `print()`, before passing it to `profvis::profvis()`
:::

## Demo!

![](assets/img/myspace_meme.png)

::: {.notes}
- Show how to change the `dev/run_dev.R` script to enable {profvis} profiling
- Launch the app, navigate to the "Overview" page, and change a filter
- Stop the app, and wait for the report to load
- Describe the flamegraph, change the filters to only show events that took time
- Navigate to the 'data' tab and discuss what took the most time

# {arrow} & the *.parquet* file format

## What are *.parquet* files?

* *.parquet* is a *columnar* storage format
* *.parquet* files not only store data, but they also store metadata about your data (i.e., data types for each column, number of rows in the file, etc.)
* Smaller files
* Faster read speed

::: {.notes}
- HOT TAKE INCOMING: parquet is the new csv
- parquet files typically are the data structure that lives behind projects like the open source Delta Lake
- faster across pretty much all benchmarks
:::

## What is the {arrow} R package?

* Part of the larger Apache Arrow project
* Connect to your data with {arrow}...
* ... and query it with {dplyr}

. . .

[Apache Arrow Homepage](https://arrow.apache.org/)

[Shiny + Arrow Article](https://posit.co/blog/shiny-and-arrow/)

::: {.notes}
- "multi-language toolbox for accelerated data interchange and in-memory processing"
- I.e., a set of data manipulation standards (particularly against parquet files) that has been implemented in a bunch of languages including R, Python, Rust, Go, and more
- {arrow} let's you use {dplyr} verbs against a single parquet file (or, perhaps more importantly, a *set* of parquet files) to query the data in those files
- When it comes to building Shiny apps, we should look for easy places where we can gain efficiency & speed to improve our user experience (you don't want users waiting 20 seconds for your data prep logic to run against a single massive csv); it's very likely that the combination of .parquet + {arrow} + {dplyr} can meet your app performance needs (it does for at least 95% of my use cases -- there are very few cases where I have to go beyond that and start looking into other engines for faster data manipulation)

# Async Processing

## Single (threaded) Line {background-image="assets/img/lego_line_pay.jpg" background-size="cover"}

* A single R process managing the different tasks in a Shiny application
* Executed one-by-one

# Should I care?

## It Depends ...

If you are the __only__ user for a quick and efficient app: Likely not

::: {.notes}
TODO: Find a way to center the sentence vertically in the slide
:::

## Crowd Pleaser

Multiple users accessing the app __concurrently__: 

* Single-threaded R process serving multiple users in typical deployments

## Asynchronous Processing (circa 2018)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### ðŸ“¦ [`{promises}`](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/index.html)

Handle objects representing the (eventual) result of an async operation

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### ðŸ“¦ [`{future}`](https://future.futureverse.org/)

Launch tasks without blocking current R session

## Introducing [`{crew}`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/)

> A distributed worker launcher for asynchronous tasks

* Extends use of the [mirai](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai) task scheduler to multiple computing backends
* Central controller object manages tasks (scales on fly)
* Supports multiple [controller groups](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/controller_groups.html) for specialized worker types
* Fits nicely with [`{targets}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and ...

## Watch-Along {background-color="#17395c"}

Using `{crew}` inside a Shiny application:

* Vignette: <https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/shiny.html>
* Application: <https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/crew-shiny>

## Setting up for Success

1. Create functions for long-running tasks
1. Create multiple [`reactiveVal`](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/latest/reactiveval) objects for bookkeeping
1. Set up a `{crew}` controller 
1. Establish an event-driven push of task to the controller with monitoring of worker status
