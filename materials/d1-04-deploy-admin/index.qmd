## More to come

::: callout-warning
These slides are under construction and will be updated continuously until the workshop date.
:::

TODO: Determine if we need to break these out into individual sections

* Posit Connect
    + Push-button deployment vs using `{rsconnect}` directly
    * Tuning application for performance
    * App usage with `{connectapi}` package
* Load-test app with `shinycannon`
* Docker containers for application
* Async Processing with `{crew}`
